		            Congratulations, you are on the best way to improve the management of your Tasks.
		        </p>		        		        		       
		        <p>
		            The aim of <b>Cotabo</b> is to provide you with a collaborative way of implementing Kanban like processes 
		            across distributed teams that don't have the chance to work togather in the same room. 
	            <p>
		            You can create multiple boards for multiple projects or workstreams.
		        </p>
		        <p>
		            Visualizing your work is one of the most basic things to improve your efficiency.
		            How can you manage something that is now visible?
		        </p>

            <p>Here is a list of features that are currently implemented:</p>
            <ul style="margin-left:50px;margin-top:10px;">
                <li>Create boards with a dynamic amount of columns & task limits on them</li>
                <li>Basic user-management (decide who should collaborate with you on the same board)</li>
                <li>Create / Update tasks - all clients that view your board will be updated on the fly (test it out by opening 2 browser instances)</li>
                <li>Marking tasks as blocked</li>
                <li>Basic chat functionality - send chat messages to everyone that looks at the boad (history won't be saved')</li>
                <li>Auto assignment of tasks (whoever pulls a task in your process flow will be the assignee)</li>
                <li>Upload an avatar for your user to easily see who is working on which task</li>
                <li>Experimental: Reporting - Comulative Flow Diagram, Average Throughput Diagram (will be improved & extended)</li>                    
            </ul>
